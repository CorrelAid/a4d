\title{Convert Wide-Format Cells to Long-Format Rows}
\usage{
wide_cells_2_rows(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame in wide-format with columns named as described.}
}
\value{
A new data frame in long-format where each row represents a single release event with columns:
\itemize{
\item The original columns from the input data frame.
\item "Released To": The recipient unit for a specific release.
\item "Units Released": The quantity of units released to the corresponding recipient.
\item "Date": The date of the release event (unchanged from the input).
\item "Received From": unchanged from the input.
}
}
\description{
This function converts a data frame from wide-format to long-format. It assumes specific column naming conventions:
\itemize{
\item Columns containing "Released To" are expected to have comma-separated values representing units released to.
\item Columns containing "Units Released" are expected to store the corresponding unit quantity for each "Released To" value.
\item A column containing "Date" (or similar) should exist to hold the date information.
}
}
\examples{
# Create a sample data frame in wide-format
df <- data.frame(
    ID = c(1, 2, 3),
    "Units Available" = c(10, 15, 20),
    "Released To A,B" = c(NA, "5-2", "8-1"),
    Date = c("2024-01-01", "2024-02-01", "2024-03-01")
)

# Convert wide-format cells to long-format rows
df_long <- wide_cells_2_rows(df)

# Print the long-format data frame
print(df_long)
}
